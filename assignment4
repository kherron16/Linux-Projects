2) Enable SSL / TLS with a passphrase

3) Disable the RC4 ciphers
4) Find a command line utility that will enable you from your minion to connect to your master to verify the ciphers that you have disabled have actually been disabled 
5) Create a certificate in D.E.R format and try to make it work. Then convert the certificate back to PEM
6) Make it so the client browser trusts the certificate of the server 
7) Create a pkcs12 bundle for someone else and distribute it to them
