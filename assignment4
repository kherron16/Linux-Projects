Configure / Setup SSL / TLS

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-an-ssl-certificate-on-apache-for-centos-7

CERT LOCATION:  /etc/pki/tls/certs/mycert.pem (created without key somehow?!)
openssl req -new -x509 -days 10 -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout mycert.pem -out mycert.pem

SSL.conf file in httpd install: /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf

2) Enable SSL / TLS with a passphrase

3) Disable the RC4 ciphers

4) Find a command line utility that will enable you from your minion to connect to your master to verify the ciphers that you have disabled have actually been disabled 
openssl s_client -connect www.onekingslane.com:443
openssl x509 -text -in cert.crt
openssl x509 -text -in cert.crt:q


5) Create a certificate in D.E.R format and try to make it work. Then convert the certificate back to PEM.

6) Make it so the client browser trusts the certificate of the server 
7) Create a pkcs12 bundle for someone else and distribute it to them
