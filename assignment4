Configure / Setup SSL / TLS

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-an-ssl-certificate-on-apache-for-centos-7

CERT LOCATION:  /etc/pki/tls/certs/mycert.pem (created without key somehow?!)
openssl req -new -x509 -days 10 -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout mycert.pem -out mycert.pem

SSL.conf file in httpd install: /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf

 openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ./test2.key -out ./test2.pem


1) Install/Enable SSL / TLS

2) Enable SSL / TLS with a passphrase

3) Disable the RC4 ciphers
openssl ciphers -v | grep RC4 (find your RC4 based ciphers)
this gives the list available to apache and open ssl...ciphers could differ

4) Find a command line utility that will enable you from your minion to connect to your master to verify the ciphers that you have disabled have actually been disabled 
openssl s_client -connect www.onekingslane.com:443
openssl x509 -text -in cert.crt


CONFIRM DISABLED (negtive test) openssl s_client -cipher RC4-MD5 -connect 192.   :443    force to use RC4-MD5, see the handshake fail

CONFIRM WORKING INTENDED (positive test) GET / HTTP/1.0   ---can run if you have network connectivity to the host
show http1 OK  get index page from document root for the server after connecting via open ssl

-encrypted vs encoded w/ s_client 

5) Create a certificate in D.E.R format and try to make it work. Then convert the certificate back to PEM.

6) Make it so the client browser trusts the certificate of the server 
7) Create a pkcs12 bundle for someone else and distribute it to them





Install/Enable SSL / TLS

Create a certificate in D.E.R format and try to make it work. Then convert the certificate back to PEM
Once the certificate is back in PEM format take the certificate NOT The private key and install it into the certificate key store for your computer
Then using safari visit the page for the web server and ensure that you DON'T get a certificate warning
 --install certiicate in browser 
Create a pkcs12 bundle for someone else and distribute it to them
Have them change their servername to match your certificate and ensure that you can start the server
